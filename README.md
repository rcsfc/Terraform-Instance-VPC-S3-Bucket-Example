# Terraform-Instance-VPC-S3-Bucket-Example
This repo is used to show an example of how you might deploy an Ubuntu instance with a simple VPC, an S3 bucket pre-configured with a user and policy in IAM, and the auth key and secret uploaded to an encrypted text file directly to the S3 bucket when the deployment is complete.
